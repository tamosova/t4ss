    <p>

        «STUB» - this is the tail, often consisting of 2-8 vertebrae, is shortened and deformed, as if planted on top of
        each
        other, are interconnected by a motionless, fractures may be felt as bumps. Vertebrae to a tail that can be
        located and
        the spiral, but they are so tightly srascheny with each other, that determine the direction of the spiral is not
        possible. Sometimes at the end of the hemp can be 1-2 vertebrae, rather thin and defend to the side, sometimes
        kept
        their partial mobility.

        «SPIRAL» - consists of 3 - 15 vertebrae deformed in such a way that fractures are created by a fairly sharp
        angle,
        forming a spiral, or «hook». Such a tail may have a different direction, it may be bent on the back and several
        of his
        vertebrae are very fit snugly to kresttsu. Connection vertebrae may be moving or polupodvizhnym possible
        combination of
        mobile and fixed sites, while bobtail can «wobble» how different parts of the tail.

        «WHISK» - consists of 5-10 vertebrae fractures formed by blunt instruments angles, possibly moving
        connect the vertebrae, and their combinations. This tail can visually look quite long, up to 1 / 3 the normal
        tail, and
        incorrectness are determined only by touch.

        «RELEGATED BOBTAIL» - begins as a normal tail, direct and free from defects in a 5-7 vertebrae, and at the end
        of
        tails formed «hook» written several already deformed vertebrae, any degree of mobility. «Hook» by their
        nature is
        often a «spiral».
